# Overview

I experimented with WebRTC and created a simple video chat app. The app is built with React, Node.js, and WebRTC.

There maybe unwanted code and not optimized code. I just wanted to experiment with WebRTC.

- I will be updating this repo with more features and optimizations.
- I will also be creating a blog post about this project.
- I will also be creating a tutorial on how to build this project.
